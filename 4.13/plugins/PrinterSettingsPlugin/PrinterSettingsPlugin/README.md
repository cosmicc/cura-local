# Printer Settings (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK)

This plugin adds many "machine settings" that are normally not accessible to the sidebar in a new category named "Printer Settings". These settings include eg the Nozzle Size, and settings that could make time estimates more accurate. Most of the newly available settings are only available by editing configuration files without this plugin. Only those settings that can be changed "on the fly" are included; for settings that affect the build volume, you still have to use the Machine Settings dialog.

Note: Changes made in the sidebar override values set in the machine definition and end up in quality profiles. This may have unexpected results. It is not recommended to use this plugin unless you understand the implications.
