## Why is it call Universal Cura Settings

Initial settings comes from some profiles released by **Jonas Idebrant** aka [printingotb](https://github.com/printingotb) on the Cura Facebook Group. The main idea was to publish an Universal Cura Settings profile based on his own printing experience. I had for a long time the idea to create a plugin which was able to set some standard parameters instead of always use some profile. When we merge the two ideas you got this UniversalCuraSettings plugin. 

**Note : It's still a "Concept" use it carrefuly.**
